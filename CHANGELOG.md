## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Artifact discovery (`internal/artifact`): scans standard Claude Code locations plus the current
  project for skills, agents, plans, hooks, and per-project memory. Tolerant of both the flat
  `name.md` and directory-with-`SKILL.md` conventions, and of files with no frontmatter at all
  (falls back to the first `#` heading as a description).
- Selector (`internal/selector`): transparent word-overlap scoring of a free-text task descriptor
  against discovered artifacts, plus a keyword-based cold-start model/effort recommendation.
- MCP server over stdio (`internal/mcp`), exposing `query_ledger`, `get_recommendation`,
  `list_proposals`, and `record_outcome`.
- `loom advise <text>` and `loom serve` CLI commands.
- Ingest, ledger, `loom report` (B1).
- Project scaffolding and design documentation.
